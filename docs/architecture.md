# SentinelGuard Architecture

SentinelGuard is designed with a modular and scalable architecture to provide efficient log analysis and anomaly detection capabilities. The architecture consists of several key components:

## Components

1. **Log Parser:** Responsible for reading log entries from log files and extracting relevant information.

2. **Log Normalizer:** Standardizes the representation of log entries by parsing and normalizing the data.

3. **Log Correlation:** Identifies patterns and relationships between log entries from different sources.

4. **Anomaly Detection:** Implements machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in log data.

5. **Alerting Mechanism:** Provides real-time alerts for identified security incidents based on configurable thresholds.

6. **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Offers an intuitive web-based interface for visualizing log data and analyzing trends.

7. **Search and Query Interface:** Enables users to perform advanced searches and queries for in-depth log analysis.

8. **Historical Analysis:** Retains historical log data for trend analysis and reporting.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
- MongoDB (optional, for database storage)

## Usage

1. Configure the tool by modifying the `config/config.yaml` file.
2. Run the main application using `python app/main.py`.
3. Explore the user-friendly dashboard and utilize the search and query interface.

## Scalability

The architecture is designed to handle large volumes of log data efficiently. The modular structure allows for easy integration of additional features and scalability for future growth.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional log sources.
- Support for more advanced anomaly detection algorithms.
- Enhanced reporting and visualization features.

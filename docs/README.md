# SentinelGuard: Log Analysis Tool

SentinelGuard is a powerful log analysis tool designed to enhance security measures by analyzing log files from various sources, such as web servers and firewalls. The tool identifies potential security incidents through log correlation and anomaly detection, providing proactive insights for threat mitigation.

## Features

- **Log File Integration:** Support for multiple log file formats, ensuring compatibility with various sources.

- **Log Parsing and Normalization:** Parse and normalize log entries to create a standardized representation.

- **Log Correlation:** Correlate log entries from different sources to provide a comprehensive view of activities.

- **Anomaly Detection:** Implement machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection.

- **Alerting Mechanism:** Real-time alerting for identified security incidents with customizable thresholds.

- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Intuitive and interactive dashboard for visualizing log data.

- **Search and Query Interface:** Robust search functionality and a query interface for advanced analysis.

- **Historical Analysis:** Retention of historical log data for trend analysis and reporting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- MongoDB (if using database storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SentinelGuard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd SentinelGuard
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

Modify the `config/config.yaml` file to set up the necessary configurations, including the path to your log file, anomaly detection threshold, and any database or web server settings.

```yaml
# /config/config.yaml

log_file_path: "path/to/your/logfile.log"
anomaly_threshold: 0.8
# Add other configurations as needed
```

### Usage

Run the main application using the following command:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

The tool will continuously analyze log data and provide insights based on your configurations.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Run a specific test file
python -m unittest tests.test_log_parser
```
